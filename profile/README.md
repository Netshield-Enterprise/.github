## Real Risk Security for CI/CD Pipelines

Most security tools tell you vulnerabilities exist.  
NetShield tells you if attackers can actually use them in **your application**.

---

## Mission

Eliminate security noise.  
Block real risk.  
Let developers ship securely at high velocity.

---

## What Makes NetShield Different

Traditional tools answer:

> "Do vulnerabilities exist?"

NetShield answers:

> "Can this vulnerability actually be exploited in this release?"

NetShield is built for **CI/CD enforcement**, not vulnerability dashboards.
